This is especially important to highlight when focused on research for global health, which is specifically about work that transcends national borders. Alami et al. (2020) discussed the unique risks raised by AI research in global health, ranging from the unavailability of data in many LMICs required to train locally relevant AI models to the capacity of health systems to absorb new AI technologies that demand the use of resources from elsewhere in the system. These observations illustrate the need to identify the unique issues posed by AI research for global health specifically, and the strategies that can be employed by all those implicated in AI governance to promote ethically responsible use of AI in global health ...",

Each year, the forum includes case studies and keynote presentations, followed by small-group discussions aimed at advancing thinking on related issues. The topics of past forums have included ethical issues in research with individuals living with mental health conditions, genome editing, and biobanking/data sharing. The forum emphasizes practical challenges in research ...",
