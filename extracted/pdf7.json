To fully harness the potential of these learning machines, users must understand their strengths and limitations. As AI tools become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, it is essential to explore how this technology has been used so far in healthcare and medical education, as well as the areas of medicine where it can be applied. This paper systematically reviews the published literature on the PubMed database from its inception up to June 6, 2024, focusi...",

This was done by reviewing the references or citations within an article from the search synthesis to find studies relevant to our research topic. Only PubMed was used because it is a repository for clinical medicine and medical education; other databases or search tools, such as Scopus, Web of Science, or Google Scholar, were not used, as their literature is not limited to biomedical, clinical, or medical sciences, which was our main focus. The search strategy registration was not required by our institution, as our study did not involve human subjects.\n\n### Selection Criteria\nArticles were selected based on the following inclusion criteria:\n1.

Among these, six studies directly compared the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 [12,18,20,22-24], with GPT-4 consistently demonstrating superior performance over GPT-3.5. The model was evaluated across various disciplines of medicine: surgery [12], parasitology [13], microbiology [14], neurology [18], and bioethics [21]. Three studies compared ChatGPT's performance with human test-takers [13,16,24]. Eight studies assessed ChatGPT's performance on national medical board exams [15,17,19,20,22-25], including the German medical licensing examination [24], the European Exam in Core Cardiology [15], the Family Medicine Board Exam in Taiwan [17], and the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 3 study question bank [23].

Many studies included were qualitative, making it difficult to generalize the results or draw definitive conclusions. Additionally, confidence intervals or p values were often unavailable, and while the authors tried to quantify the findings, most studies remained qualitative by nature. This is likely due to the relatively recent introduction of AI models like ChatGPT to the public, meaning the existing literature consists of smaller, less structured studies. Many studies also lacked control groups or relied on self-assessment, which could introduce bias. The review was also limited to studies from PubMed, leaving out potentially relevant research from other sources.
