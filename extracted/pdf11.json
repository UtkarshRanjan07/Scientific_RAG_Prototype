It highlights the significant role of patient history in the diagnostic process and aims to understand how AI incorporates this information in clinical diagnoses.\n\n## Introduction\nDiagnostic errors are a significant concern in healthcare, contributing to approximately 40,500 deaths annually in the United States due to misdiagnoses. Reports indicate that diagnostic errors account for 10% of deaths and are a leading cause of medical malpractice claims. The importance of patient history in the diagnostic process has been emphasized, with studies suggesting it contributes to 80% of diagnoses. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to increased focus on AI-assisted diagnoses across various medical fields. However, the role of patient history in AI-assisted diagnosis remains underexplored. This study ...",

In the event of a misdiagnosis, analyzing the process that led to the false diagnosis could be challenging in an AI-assisted medical diagnosis. Given the current situation where reflection on misdiagnoses is not always feasible, AI should be used as an auxiliary tool in medical diagnosis. This approach underscores the importance of AI, deeming it a support system rather than a definitive diagnostic solution. This area needs further investigation. Future studies should also verify our results with certain common conditions or diseases, such as the top 10 diseases identified in the Global Burden of Diseases study [34], potentially leveraging the benefits and limitations of AI-assisted medical diagnosis.\n\n## Conclusions\nRelevant patient history is essential for AI-assisted d...",
