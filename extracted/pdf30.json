This paper explores the potential of AI in revolutionizing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, addressing traditional diagnostic challenges, and improving patient outcomes. By leveraging AI's capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision support, we can envision a future where TB diagnosis is more accurate, timely, equitable, and accessible to all populations.\n\n## Introduction\nTuberculosis remains one of the oldest known infectious diseases, posing significant public health challenges globally. Traditional diagnostic methods often fall short in terms of speed, accuracy, and accessibility. The integration of AI into TB diagnostics presents an opportunity to overcome these challenges and enhance the overall effectiveness of TB management.\n\n## Method...",
