This paper discusses the ethical guidelines necessary for maintaining moral behavior that prioritizes patient needs and upholds the core values of the medical profession. It emphasizes the importance of regular reflection on ethical issues by healthcare workers to navigate the complexities of medical practice with integrity and compassion.\n\n## Introduction\nThe need to track patient safety, confidentiality, traceability, accountability, and privacy is critical in developing electronic healthcare approaches. Strategies must be implemented to address potential violations. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a framework to integrate technology and digital advancements into healthcare. The WHO's guidelines stress the importance of assessing these technologies based on criteria such as benefits, potential negative effects, ...",

Some of these are basic principles that are frequently applied in bioethics: justice (ensuring equality and that no person or group is vulnerable to discrimination, neglect, manipulation, dominance, or exploitation), autonomy (the respect for one's own best interests while making decisions), and beneficence and non-maleficence (that is, to do nothing that harms and reduce the benefit/risk trade-off). Conversely, other principles are derived from legal and moral ideals. Sustaining the epistemological component of intelligibility is emphasized by...",

Bias\nAI bias is an alarming issue in AI-driven medical imaging (MI). AI models may inherit biases in the training data, which could result in inaccurate diagnoses or therapy suggestions. To reduce such dangers, regulatory requirements should require rigorous data screening and bias reduction techniques (Challen et al., 2019).\n\n### 2.2.3. Accountability\nIn AI-driven MI, accountability has some complexities. It highlights the question of accountability when an AI system produces a recommendation that is damaging or inaccurate. Rules for assessing responsibility and liability need to be established by regulatory frameworks; these rules ma...",

First of all, because technology is frequently expanding more quickly than legal frameworks, it might be difficult to keep up with the quickly evolving uses of AI. Additionally, there are problems with the interpretability and transparency of AI algorithms, which could hinder efforts at regulation due to the fact that comprehending the way these systems make decisions is crucial for safety and transparency. Data security and privacy issues also pose significant hurdles, especially when sharing MI data to train AI models. Finding a balance between the need for data access and privacy considerations is challenging (Mennella et al., 2024; Petersson et al., 2023).\n\n## Introduction\nSince AI systems need to readily interface with existing instruments and platforms, interop...",
