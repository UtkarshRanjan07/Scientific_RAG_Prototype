The discovery and introduction of novel antibiotics are time-consuming and expensive. According to WHO\u2019s report of antibacterial agents in clinical development, only 18 novel antibiotics have been approved since 2014. Therefore, novel antibiotics are critically needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly applied to drug development since its recent technical breakthrough and has dramatically improved the efficiency of the discovery of novel antibiotics. Here, we first summarized recently marketed novel antibiotics, and antibiotic candidates in clinical development. In additi...",

This review discusses the current state of antibacterial drug development, highlighting the challenges faced and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in accelerating the discovery of novel antibiotics.\n\n## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a natural phenomenon wherein microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, develop the ability to survive the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human medicine, animal agriculture, and the environment have accelerated the emergence and spread of AMR. This phenomenon renders once-effective treatments ineffectual, leading to prolonged illnesses, increased mortality rates, and higher healthcare costs. Thus, AMR is a serious and foremost global threat to human health that requires urgent practical act...",

Polymyxins are cyclic lipopeptides with 5 positively charged 2,4-diamino butyric acid groups [19]. They are an old class of antibiotics developed in the 1950s and were replaced by other safer antibiotics due to their renal toxicity [20]. However, the emergence of extensively-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, which are resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics and only susceptible to one or two antibiotics, has posed significant challenges to clinics.

Later, Moradi-garavand et al. [169] demonstrated that the gradient boosted decision tree model stood out as the best ML model for predicting the resistance of *E. coli* against eleven compounds across four major antibiotic classes. Moreover, Her et al. [174] took a pan-genome-based approach and found that AMR genes are unevenly distributed in the core and accessory genomes. Dividing the pan-genome into core and accessory parts further improved prediction accuracy in *E. coli*.\n\nLarge and high-quality trainin...",

The need for rapid and accurate methods to determine antibiotic susceptibility is critical. Traditional methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are time-consuming, often leading to empirical treatment that may contribute to AMR.\n\n## Methods\nWeis et al. [189] combined ML algorithms with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to accelerate AMR determination. They created the DRIAMS dataset, which includes extensive resistance data and mass spectrometry data from clinical strains. Three ML algorithms were trained: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and LightGBM, with MLP and LightGBM showing the best performance.\n\n## Re...",

Combining whole-genome sequencing and machine learning (ML) analysis of a large-scale longitudinal database of urinary and wound clinical isolates pre- and post-treatment from the same patient, Stracy et al. found that treatment-induced resistance emergence is largely caused by re-infection of a different resistant clone rather than de novo resistance evolution. Moreover, as a recurrence-causing resistant clone most frequently comes from a patient\u2019s microbiota, it is in many cases reflected by the patient\u2019s inf...",
