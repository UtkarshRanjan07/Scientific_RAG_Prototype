Doing so will enable the future workforce to leverage AI in practice and adapt to emerging technologies in the service of providing high-quality patient care. While AI\u2019s potential continues to evolve and offer dynamic opportunities in health care, there are signals from the field on how AI should be integrated into medical education. However, the field is outpacing the development of competencies and consensus practice standards, with medical educators seeking clarity on introducing and infusing AI into the curriculum in a way that appropriately prepares the future workforce. Measuring progress and curricular approaches is critical to understanding the current landscape and opportunities. To better under...",

Of 157 eligible U.S. MD-granting schools, 149 (95%) participated in the survey, and of 38 eligible U.S. DO-granting schools, 30 (79%) participated. Additionally, three (23%) of 13 eligible Canadian medical schools participated in the 2024 administration of the Curriculum SCOPE Survey.\n\nThe response rate for the 2023 Curriculum SCOPE Survey was 87% (166 of 192) among the U.S. MD- and DO-granting schools. Of the 155 eligible U.S. MD-granting schools, 139 (90%) participated in the survey, and of the 37 eligible U.S. DO-granting schools, 27 (73%) participated.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Key Finding 1: Most MD- and DO-granting schools have integrated AI into the curriculum \u2014 with impressive growth over one year.\nIn both the 2023 survey and 2024 survey, we asked schools whether A...",
