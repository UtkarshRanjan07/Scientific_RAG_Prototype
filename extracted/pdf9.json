It was based on a careful examination of existing literature and findings from recent studies. By providing medical professionals with an in-depth understanding of how AI can be used to diagnose and treat infectious diseases, by working together to advance the use of AI to combat infectious diseases, and by providing patients with more accurate and efficient healthcare, this will not only be important in improving global public health.\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial intelligence, particularly its variations like deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is currently the most used machine learning technique. Data is sent to the input layer, which uses a hidden multi-layer alg...",

At the very least, machine learning-based alert systems have been created that detect deviations in disease rates or the ways infectious diseases are spread, alerting health authorities to potential outbreaks [18]. AI has shown great potential in the tract of learned profession imagination, which is essential for diagnosis. Profound learning systems, a different kind of artificial intelligence, have demonstrated accuracy in analyzing medical images, including X-ray a...",
