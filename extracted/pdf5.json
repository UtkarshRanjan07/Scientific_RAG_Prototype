A total of 85 questions were gathered, with 10 duplicates removed, resulting in 75 questions evaluated for inclusion. The questions were categorized into general information, diagnosis, treatment &#x26; follow-up, quality of life, and case examples. Responses were generated using ChatGPT and evaluated by two physiatrists and two experts in pediatric rehabilitation medicine for accuracy.\n\n# Introduction\nScheuermann\u2019s kyphosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine. Patients often have questions regarding their condition, treatment options, and quality of life. This study aims to assess how well ChatGPT can provide accurate and comprehensive answers to these questions, reflecting real-world interactions.\n\n# Methods\nQuestions were gathered from various sources and categorized as follows:\n1.

Out of 75 questions, the responses were as follows: 43 (57.33%) questions received correct and comprehensive answers (score 1), 29 (38.67%) questions received correct but not comprehensive answers (score 2), three (4%) questions received partially incorrect answers (score 3), and 0 questions received completely incorrect answers (score 4). The distribution of scores across question categories is illustrated in Figure 2. ChatGPT demonstrated its best performance in the quality of life category, with responses to 16 out of 19 questions graded as correct and comprehensive answers. The second-best performance was in the general knowledge category, with 15 (62.3%) out of 24 questions scored as correct and comprehensive answers (score 1). The worst performance was in the diagnosis category, where three (37.5%) out of eight responses were rated as correct and comprehensive. Similarly, in the treatment and follow-up category, only...",

We assessed the accuracy of its responses to case-based questions. Overall, ChatGPT\u2019s responses were accurate, with the majority rated as comprehensive and demonstrating high reproducibility. However, it provided approximately 40% of the answers correctly, with notable weaknesses in diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.\n\n## Introduction\nChatGPT has been increasingly utilized in medical specialties to provide information and answer patient inquiries. Previous studies have shown varying levels of accuracy in its responses, highlighting the need for oversight by healthcare professionals. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT's performance specifically in the context of Scheuermann\u2019s kyphosis.\n\n## Methods\nWe conducted a review of ChatGPT's responses to a series of questions related to Scheuer...",

However, making accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions often requires clinical expertise, a comprehensive understanding of individual patient contexts, and the ability to consider nuanced factors that AI may not fully grasp. Consequently, while AI can enhance the decision-making process, it cannot replace the critical role of healthcare professionals in effectively diagnosing and treating patients. It is important to note that ChatGPT was not specifically trained on Scheuermann\u2019s kyphosis or other specialized medical conditions. Its general training aims to simulate typical real-world interactions, which may limit its effectiveness for highly specialized queries.
