It begins with pedagogical theories and human responses to AI, followed by discussions on AI's impact on personal and flexible assessment, standardization, and assessment types. The guide also addresses AI as a tutor and learner, competency-based assessment, and ethical issues, concluding with faculty development and the acknowledgment of AI usage in HPE assessment.\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThe guide is structured to logically present topics, starting with educational theoretical frameworks and moving towards practical applications of AI in assessment. It emphasizes that while AI can enhance assessment, it is not a panacea for all educational challenges. The focus remains on identifying areas in HPE assessment that can benefit from AI while recognizing potential issues.\n\n## 2. Theories and Frameworks\n...",

By providing real-time feedback and competency evaluations, on-demand assessments support personalized learning paths, enabling learners to progress through training phases at their own pace. These assessments enable learners to demonstrate readiness for each phase when they feel prepared, aligning with their individual learning paths and career trajectories, rather than a set timeline [4]. This approach supports progression based on demonstrated competency rather than time, confirming a learner\u2019s readiness to advance [25].\n\nAs AI-driven assessments continue to evolve, they offer a promising pathway for preparing learners for phase completion and certification, ultimately ensuring readiness for the demands of professional practice.

Conclusion\nAI-generated items show great promise and can be used, but it is essential that they meet both the standards of conventional psychometric validation and the public\u2019s trust. Therefore, high-stakes assessments should ensure that such items have been reviewed by humans or continue to rely on well-established test items that have undergone extensive validation. This ensures that the standards of fairness, reliability, and equity in HPE assessment remain uncompromised as new AI-driven tools are integrated into HPE. More rigorous and systematic research is needed before GenAI can be reliably used in high-stakes standardized assessments, but its potential to enhance consistency, fairness, and scalability is promising. Educators can ensure that assessments remain relevant to the learner\u2019s current skill level. These AI-driven tools, detailed further in Appendix 3, highlight the potential for using GenAI in both question creation and targeted feedback.\n\n## ...",

Although the authors\u2019 personal biases towards AI have influenced their work and approaches, we have attempted to maintain a balance, so that educators can approach the challenges, problems, and solutions with full and realistic awareness of the possible positive and negative impact of AI. In this way, we have aimed to provide HPE educators with a Guide to assist them in their journey of successfully using AI for HPE assessment.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge comments made by reviewers on a previous version of this paper.\n\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n## Funding\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associa...",
