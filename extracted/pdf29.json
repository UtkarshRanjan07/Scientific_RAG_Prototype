This study examined the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of health professions\u2019 students in Jordan concerning AI, providing insights into their preparedness and perceptions.\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a comprehensive term encompassing the technology that enables computer hardware and software to mimic intelligent human behavior and reach human-level performance [1]. AI-powered technologies have been implemented in many professions such as law, finance, computer science, and industrial manufacturing [2]. This rapid expansion and e...",

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2023) 23:288\n\n## Abstract\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the education and training of health professions\u2019 students is becoming increasingly significant. A computer-aided learning system has been developed to assist health professions\u2019 students in gaining diagnostic experience through a machine learning model trained on numerous clinical cases. Virtual Patients have emerged as an effective platform for undergraduate nursing students to enhance their communication skills prior to engaging with real patients. Despite the growing presence of AI in the medical field, its impact on health professions\u2019 students remains unclear. Studies indicate that AI may diminish enthusiasm among students in certain medical fields, such as radiology. Furthermore, there is a lack of resources addressing the implications of AI in medical training, particularly in the Middle East. While various studies have assessed the Know...",

Morgan equation was applied with a 95% significance level and a 5% margin of error to calculate the minimum required sample size (385 participants). The current study included 483 students.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\nSPSS version 28.0 was used to analyze the data. Frequencies and percentages were used to present all categorical variables, and median (95% CI) for continuous variables. The distribution of the data was evaluated by examining histograms and Q-Q plots which indicated that the data was not normally distributed; therefore, nonparametric tests were conducted. To determine variables associated with KAP scores, three quantile regression models were constructed....",

Notably, participants exhibited a strong understanding of certain aspects of AI, such as the requirement for labeled data for AI learning and the identification of barriers to AI implementation in medicine. However, a significant proportion of students reported limited exposure to formal AI education within their curriculum. Low or moderate levels of knowledge of AI and exposure within the curriculum have also been rep...",
