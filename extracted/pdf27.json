It relies on optimizing the operations and predictions in analytics, computer diagnostics, and image segmentation. Clinical procedures rely on personalized medication and diagnostic techniques. The challenges AI encounters in radiography include the \u2018black box\u2019 issue, accuracy of data, technological and infrastructural complexity, ethical issues such as patient privacy and data security, overreliance on AI, and bias. This article determines the various aspects involved in the use of AI in medical diagnosis (radiological), summarizes the p...",

Artificial intelligence algorithms in various industries, such as technology, social media, e-commerce, health systems, finance, hiring, social welfare, and digital law enforcement, are under strict scrutiny for many types of bias. Scientific literature and courts have thoroughly documented these biases. They have highlighted the absence of robust regulations safeguarding marginalized communities from the negative impacts of these technologies, primarily because of the lack of consensus on the definition of bias in the decisions made by data-driven algorithms. The evidence and notions of bias and fairness form the foundation of many AI algorithms that handle complex data. The primary challenge lies in the sophisticated nature of these algorithms, which various complex social, political, and fle...",
