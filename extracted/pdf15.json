Deep learning algorithms learn composition of data that is represented in a hierarchy of structures of simpler features as a representation of the complex data. Deep learning neural networks exploit a vast number of extremely simple computational units, called artificial neurons, which are organized in deep stacks of interconnecting layers. Specific deep learning architectures known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be extremely adaptable to general image-based tasks such as segmentation, object detection, and object classification.\n\n## Introduction\nRadiomics refers to the automated extraction and analysis of quantitative features of an image, su...",

Advancements in instrumentation technology and reconstruction technology have addressed these concerns to some degree, particularly in multidetector helical CT and high field-strength MRI [44]. However, image reconstruction in nuclear medicine imaging still lags behind its radiological counterparts. The process involves various computationally intensive steps, including attenuation correction, scatter correction, noise correction, and partial volume correction.
