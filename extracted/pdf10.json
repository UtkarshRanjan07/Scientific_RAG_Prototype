This requires rigorous ethical validation, compliance with regulatory standards, and clear guidelines for clinical AI use to ensure equitable care.\n\n## Introduction\nValidation gaps have been identified as a significant limitation in numerous studies, particularly affecting multi-omics integration models, which experience severe performance declines when tested on external cohorts. These observations resonate with recent cautions regarding \u201csilent failures\u201d in clinical AI, whereby models lack the ability to generalize because they are trained on narrowly defined demographic groups.
