However, it may not be possible to fully validate the App with conventional approaches; more sophisticated approaches may be needed such as investigating machine behaviour (Rahwan et al. 2019).\n\n## Introduction\nUpdates to the AI software or hardware would need re-testing or bridging studies to ensure reproducibility/validation.

It emphasizes the importance of data accessibility, governance, data security, and management of both new and old data in ensuring the safe and effective use of AI technologies in clinical settings.\n\n## Introduction\nThe integration of AI into healthcare presents unique challenges and opportunities. Regulatory bodies must ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a manner that prioritizes patient safety and data integrity. This paper outlines the key considerations for regulatory frameworks governing AI in healthcare.\n\n## Methods\nThe analysis is based on a review of existing guidelines and frameworks proposed by regulatory agencies, including the EMA and...",

In this case, as the device is included in the label of the medicinal product as a diagnostic and used to adjust posology, the below post-marketing requirements would be considered.\n\nReproducibility will need to be established for each App version through re-testing. Equally, new data linkages, e.g. the integration of new Electronic Health Records, would require reproducibility tests. This is the responsibility for the company to carry out. Verifying the algorithm performance and reliability when it is applied in a real-world setting may also be required in the post-marketing phase. Ideally, the App should be unchanging between the initial MAA and HTA assessment.\n\n## Hardware and Firmware\n\n### EMA\nAs it is a medical device, the usual post-marketing surveillance requirements apply. Bridging studies may also be required i...",

This could include AI development and use in the context of developing and using medicinal products for treatment and/or diagnosis. This could start with regulatory concerns that cut across areas of medicines regulation and the medicine life cycle.\n- Regulators may need to elaborate a risk-based approach to assessing and regulating AI, and this could be informed through exchange and collaboration in ICMRA. The scientific or clinical validation of AI use would require a sufficien...",

The new EU regulations on In vitro diagnostics (IVD) medical devices (Reg. (EU) 746/2017) give more stringent requirements for companion diagnostics to be used with medicinal products. A similar approach could be discussed for digital technologies, when their use impacts the medicinal product\u2019s use and/or its benefit/risk; for example when the technology is used for the selection of patients eligible to the treatment, as was also the case in the CNS case study, or when it is used as add-on, substitution, co-administration therapy).
