AI-powered tools such as automated literature reviews and machine learning algorithms are being utilized to analyze vast amounts of medical data, identifying patterns and connections that may not be evident to human researchers. However, challenges remain before AI can fully realize its potential in this domain.\n\n## Introduction\nAI has taken the healthcare industry by storm, and the field of medical literature is no exception. One of the ways AI is being used in medical literature is by assisting in the identification and organization of existing literature. With terabytes of data being produced every day, AI makes it possible to filter through this data and extract only what is relevant. Through natural language processing (NLP) and machine lea...",

While there are several challenges, AI is still expected to play a significant role in the future of medical literature, and its full potential is yet to be realized [7].\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence has revolutionized the field of Medical Literature, but it has also brought forward ethical concerns. Data privacy and security remain critical issues, as AI requires large amounts of patient data. Medical literature using AI must be transparent about the sources of data used to derive insights and maintain strict patient confidentiality. Additionally, there is a growing dependence on AI, which raises concerns about the possibility of machines making decisions about medical literature. These issues need to be carefully add...",
