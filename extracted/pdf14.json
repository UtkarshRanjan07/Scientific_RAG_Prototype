This event is widely regarded as the beginning of AI as a formal field of study. To better understand AI, it is essential to clarify the differences between artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science.\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science are related but distinct fields. Artificial intelligence is the broadest field, encompassing a range of techniques and methods aimed at creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and natural language processing. AI can be divided into several branches, including expert systems, robotics,...",

The first applications of AI were primarily in academia and government research institutions, but as technology has advanced, AI has also been applied in industry and commerce (5). One of the earliest examples of AI in everyday life was the use of expert systems in the 1980s and 1990s. These were computer programs that could mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular field, such as medicine or finance. In the 21st century, AI has been increasingly integrated into a variety of consumer pr...",
