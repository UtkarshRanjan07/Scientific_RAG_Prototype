A subfield of precision medicine known as radiomics applies mathematical analysis to medical images, revealing disease-specific processes beyond human visual perception as shown in Figure 1. Radiomics involves extracting quantitative features from imaging modalities like MRI, CT, PET, and ultrasound. These data, analyzed using statistical software, contribute to personalized precision medicine. Machine learning (ML), a core AI component, builds predictive models from historical data. In veterinary contexts, AI helps decipher host-pathogen interactions, develop precision therapies, and improve predictive epidemiology. AI enhances diagnostic accuracy, proposes treatment plans, identifies risk factors, and fosters the development of targeted therapies (Bibault et al., 2020, Ezanno et al., 2021) [5, 14].\n\n## 5.1 Disease Diagnosis\n\nEa...",

From enhancing disease diagnosis to outbreak prediction and speeding up drug and vaccine development, AI technologies have tools that can significantly improve the health of animals. However, careful implementation is imperative, involving investment in data infrastructure, upskilling professionals, and establishing ethical guidelines that regulate AI use in veterinary facilities.\n\n## 1. Introduction\nAI enhances reproductive efficiency through data analysis and image recognition. Predictive models identify optimal breeding windows, assess fertility, and guide insemination timing. CASA and flow cytometry enable precise semen analysis, improving sire selection (Zuidema et al., 2021) [33]. AI tools monitor oestrus signs, behavior, and reproductive health from video and image data, enabling precision breeding and boosting conception rates.\n\n#...",
