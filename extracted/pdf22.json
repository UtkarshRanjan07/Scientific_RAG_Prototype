This commentary explores the responsibilities of medical radiation professionals in ensuring the ethical and effective use of AI technologies in their field.\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics behind the use of artificial intelligence in medical imaging is complex and beyond the scope of this commentary. For the interested reader, several white papers and position statements explore these issues in detail [22,37,38]. The quality of the data on which these algorithms are trained is essential in ensuring safe use. Supervised learning algorithms require a substantial collection of radiological data, validated by experts, and widely agreed upon by both the medical radiation science and the computer science community [39]. Even so, data that are well validated is still only fit for the population from which it is...",

This study investigates the prevalence and contributing factors of burnout in these professions across Australia and New Zealand.\n\n## Introduction\nBurnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. It can lead to decreased job performance and increased turnover rates. This research aims to assess the levels of burnout among radiographers, sonographers, and radiologists, and to identify the factors that contribute to this phenomenon.\n\n## Methods\nA national survey was conducted involving radiographers, sonographers, and radiologists. Participants were asked to complete a standardized burnout inventory, along with demographic and work-related questions. Data were analyzed ...",
