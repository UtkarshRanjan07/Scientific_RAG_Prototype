Kohane, M.D., Ph.D.**\n\nReceived: October 17, 2023; Accepted: October 19, 2023; Published: December 11, 2023\n\n### Abstract\nIntroducing a new journal from NEJM Group: NEJM AI, a platform aimed at informing readers and guiding the responsible development of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the quality of health care. This editorial reflects on AI\u2019s historical milestones and current capabilities, particularly large language models, and the imperative for their rigorous clinical evaluation. It discusses the crucial need for AI in medicine to undergo the same level of scrutiny as any clinical intervention, predominantly through randomized controlled trials, despite the challenges posed by the technology\u2019s complexity. Looking forward, NEJM AI commits to fostering a multidisciplinary discourse and the development of a transparent, patient-centered approach to AI in h...",

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) in 2022 has reignited optimism about the potential of AI in healthcare. However, the need for rigorous clinical evidence, particularly through randomized controlled trials, remains critical. The evaluation of LLMs poses unique challenges due to their broad capabilities and the necessity for a collaborative approach among various stakeholders. The future of AI in healthcare will depend on multidisciplinary contributions and the establishment of well-annotated datasets.\n\n# Introduction\nThe historical context of computing in medicine dates back to at least the 1950s. In 1970, endocrinologist William Schwarz predicted that computing science would significantly influence physician functions and medical care quality. F...",
