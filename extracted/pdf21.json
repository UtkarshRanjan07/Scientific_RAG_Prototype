Wouters\u00b2 ID**\n\n## Abstract\nRegulation of health technologies must be rigorous, instilling trust among both healthcare providers and patients. This is especially important for the control and supervision of the growing use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. In this commentary on the accompanying piece by Van Laere and colleagues, we set out the scope for applying artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector and outline five key challenges that regulators face in dealing with these modern-day technologies. Addressing these challenges will not be easy. While artificial intelligence applications in healthcare have already made rapid progress and benefitted patients, these applications clearly hold even more potential for future developments. Yet i...",

However, the integration of AI into clinical practice raises significant challenges for regulators, including issues of data quality, bias, and compliance with data protection legislation.\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial intelligence can utilize a wide range of data inputs, although most early applications in healthcare relied on visual images, such as those used in radiology (e.g., positron emission tomography scans), pathology (e.g., images of cells and tissues), or ophthalmology (e.g., retinal pictures). This has expanded to the analysis of complex three-dimensional images, such as those obtained at colonoscopy, and a wide range of physiological data, such as that generated by echocardiography, primarily aimed at making diagnoses.\n\nIn some cases, data are be...",

This paper discusses the regulatory landscape surrounding AI applications in clinical decision support, highlighting the need for comprehensive frameworks that ensure patient safety while fostering innovation.\n\n## Introduction\nArtificial intelligence is transforming healthcare by providing tools that can enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. However, the rapid development of these technologies raises critical regulatory questions. This paper aims to explore the current state of AI regulation in healthcare and propose pathways for effective oversight.\n\n## Methods\nThe analysis is based on a review of existing literature and regulatory frameworks from the US and European authorities regarding AI in clinical settings. Key challenges and opportunities are identified throug...",
